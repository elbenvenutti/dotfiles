U.S. custom keyboard layout README.txt
======================================

About
=====

This is a keyboard layout for Mac computers. It has two main
purposes:

* It provides a compose key. The compose key is mapped to two keys on
  the keyboard: ยง (on an ISO keyboard), โง^F13.

* It allows accessing the option key combos even if the physical
  option key is used for something else (e.g. for a meta key in a
  terminal).

This keyboard layout has been written by j. 'mach' wust. For more
information, see: http://uscustom.sf.net/


Installation
============

1. Drag the files UScustom.keylayout and UScustom.icns to either one
of /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/.

2. Log out and log in again to complete the installation (it may work
right away).

3. In the International section of the System Preferences, you can
now select "U.S. custom" for the Input Menu. It is now available from
in the menu bar at the top right margin of the screen.


Requirements
============

This is a Mac keyboard layout. It works only on a Mac.

This keyboard layout works best on a physical ISO keyboard. These are
the ones where the enter key is shaped like a turned capital letter
L. The reason why it works best on an ISO keyboard is that it relies
heavily on the additional key the ISO keyboards provide.


Editing the keyboard layout
===========================

If you wish to edit the keyboard layout, I recommend using
TextWrangler, a powerful free (but not open) text editor of Bare
Bones Software: <http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/>

You may use Ukelele, the free SIL Mac OS X Keyboard Layout Editor,
for viewing the U.S. custom keyboard layout and for pre-validating
any changes you have made. Previous versions of Ukelele would mess up
this keyboard layout.
